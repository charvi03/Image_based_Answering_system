Data Cleaning:
Data Cleaning data tend be incomplete noisy and inconsistent Data cleaning for data cleansing touches attempt to fill missing values smooth out noise while identic outliers and correct inconsistencies in the data In this section You will study basic methods for data cleaning Section looks way of handling missing values Section 2.2 explains data smoothing techniques Section 2.3 discusses approaches data cleaning process Missing Values Imagine that need analyze sales and customer data You note that maDly rules have no recorded value for several attributes such as customer income How go about flying in the _ missing values for this attributed Let's look at the following methods Ignore the duplex This usually done when the class label is missing assuming the mining task involves classification This method effective , unless the tulle contains several attributes with missing values especially poor when the percent age of see per attribute Varies considerably By ignoring the duplex not make Use of the remaining attributes values in the duplex Such data could have hen useful the task at hands Fill in the missing value manually general this approach is time consuming and say not be feasible given large data set with many missing values Use global constant to fill in the missing value Replace all missing attribute values by the same constant such label like Unknown missing values are replaced by say unknown then the mining program MaY mistakenly think that they form an interesting concept since they all have value in Common that of unknown hence although this method simple foolproof Use measure of central tendency for the attribute beg , the mean median fill in the missing value Chapter discussed measures of central tendency which indicate the middle value of data distribution For normal asymmetric data dis - the mean be used while skewed data distribution should employ the median section . For example suppose that the data distribution regard in the income of customers is symmetric and that the mean income Use this value replace the missing value for income Use the attribute mean median for all samples belonging the some class the given duplex For example if classifying customers according we replace the missing value with the mean couch value for customers in the same credit risk category as that of the given duplex If the data distribution for given class skewed the median value better choice Use the most probable value fill in the missing value This may be determined with regression tools using formalism decision tree lying very missing

Naive Classification:
The naive classifier or simple classifier works as follows Let be training set of rules and their associated class labels As usual each tulle is represented by an dimensional attribute vector X = and , depicting measurements made on the tulle from attributes respectively a azo Suppose that there are m classes cig czar my Given duplex xu the classifier will predict that X belongs to the class having the highest posterior probability condo tinned on X That is the naive classifier predicts that tulle X belongs to the class i and only if > for 1 < thus We maximize The class c for which is maximized is called the maximum posterior hypothesis By bases theorem , = pox

Clustering:
Clustering techniques consider data rules objects partition the objects into groups that objects within cluster are similar one another and dish similar i objects other clusters Similarity commonly defend in terms of how close the objects are in space based on distance function The quality of cluster be represented by its diameter the maximum distance between two objects in the cluster Centroid distance an alternative measure of cluster quality and defined the average distance of each cluster object from the cluster centroid denoting the average object average point space for the cluster . Figure showed plot of customer data with respect customer locations city Three data clusters are visible In data reduction the cluster representations the data are Used to replace the actual data The effectiveness of this technique depends on the data $ nature much more elective for data that in be organized into distinct clusters than for smeared data There are many measure for defining clusters and cluster quality Clustering meths gods are further described in Chapters i and he Sampling Sampling can be used as data reduction technique because allows large data set be represented by much smaller random data sample for subset . Suppose that data set contains rules Let the most COmmon Ways that we could sample for data reduction illustrated in Figure _ Simple random sample without replacement of size This created by drawing of the rules from D i no where the probability of drawing any tulle in Dis in that is all rules are to be sampled Simple random sample with replacement of size This similar to except that each time tulle drawn from do recorded and then replaced That is after tulle drawn placed back in do that . may be drawn They large equally likely ai

Data Transformation:
Data Transformation Strategies Overview In data transformation the data are transformed consolidated into forms appropriate for mining Strategies for data transformation include the following smoothing which works remove noise from the data Techniques include binning regression and clustering 2. Attribute construction for feature construction where attributes strutted added from the given set of attributes help the mining process aggregation where summary Or aggregation operations applied to the data daily sales data may be aggregated so as to compute monthly and annual total This step typically me constructing data cube for data analysis multiple abstraction levels normalization where the attribute data are scaled i is fall within smaller type such as let to 0.0 to where the raw values of a numeric attribute we go replaced by interval labels conceptual labels edge youth adult senior . The labels turn c recursively Organized into concepts resulting in concept hierarchy for the numeric attributed Figure - 12 shows concept hierarchy for the attribute price More than one Concept hierarchy can be defined for the same attribute accommodate the needs of various users generation for nominal data , where attributes such sleet can generalized concepts like city country Many hierarchies for gonna attributes are implicit within the database schema and can be automatically defined at the schema definition level and

Data warehouse:
Data warehousing provides architectures and tools for business executives apically organized understand and their data make strategic decisions Data warehouse systems are valuable tools today competitive world In the last sever a many his have millions dollars in building data warehouses Many people feel that with competition mounting in every industry data warehousing the latest marketing weapon retain customers by learning more about their needs then what a data warehouse Data warehouses defined i ways making difficult formulate rigorous definition Loosely speaking data warehouse refers data repository that maintained separately from organize ton $ operational databases Data warehouse systems allow for integration of & variety of application systems They support information processing by providing = solid platform of consolidated historic data for analysis According nor , leading architect in the construction of data warehouse systems a data warehouse integrated and nonsalable collection of data support of management's decision making pro cess This short but comprehensive definition presents the major features of data warehouse The four keywords integrated and nonvolatile distinguish data warehouses from other data repository systems such as relational database systems transaction processing systems and file systems Let $ take closer look at each these key features _ data warehouse organized around major subjects such case tower supplier product and sales Rather than concentrating the operations and transaction processing of in organization data warehouse focuses modeling and analysis of data for decision makers hence data warehouses typically provide simple and concise view of particular subject issues by excluding data that are not Useful in the decision support process integrated data warehouse usually constructed by integrating multiple hetero generous chances such relational databases flat files and online records Data cleaning and data integration techniques are applied ensure cunt sisterly in naming conventions encoding structures attribute measures and On Spent

ETL:
extraction Transformation Loading Data warehouse systems Use backbend tools and utilities populate and refresh their data figure These tools and utilities include the following functions Data extraction which typically gathers data from multiple heterogeneous and extra sources Data cleaning which detects errors the data and rectifies them when possible Data transformation which converts data from legacy or host format warehouse load which sorts summarizes consolidates computes views checks integrity and builds indices and partitions refresh which propagates the updates from the data sources the warehouse Besides cleaning loading refreshing and definition tools data warehouse systems usually provide - set of data warehouse management tools Data cleaning and data transformation steps improving the data quality and subsequently the data mining results see Chapter Because are most interested the aspects of data warehousing technology related data mining we will get into the details the remaining tools recommend interested readers consult books dedicated data warehousing technology and good

Regression:
Regression used data in real valued prediction variable actual it regression involves the leaving the function that does mapping Regression assume S that the target data fit into some known type of function linear et ) and then determines the best function of this type that models the giver data Some type of error analysis used determine which function best Standard linear regression , as illustrated Example is simple example of regression logistics

Prediction:
Prediction data mining applications predicting future data stales based on past and current data Prediction can be viewed - type of class note This data mining task that different from the prediction model although the are diction task is type of prediction model ) The difference that prediction predicting state rather than cutting stale . Here referring type of application rather than type of data mining modeling approach discussed earlier Prediction applications include flooding speech recognition machine leaving ad patted recon Although valet be predicted using time series analysis regression techniques other approaches may be used well Example 15 illustrates the process want hurt future

Time Series Analysis:
