Introduction to WWW:
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. It was developed in the late 1980s by Tim Berners-Lee and has since become a fundamental aspect of modern life, providing access to vast amounts of information, services, and resources. The WWW operates on the basis of URLs, HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and HTML, allowing users to navigate between documents by clicking on hyperlinks.

HTML:
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of a series of elements, or tags, that define the structure and content of a document. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render text, images, multimedia, and other elements on the screen. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new features for multimedia, semantics, and accessibility.

XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language):
XHTML is a reformulation of HTML as an XML application. It follows the stricter syntax rules of XML, requiring well-formed documents with properly nested elements and lowercase tag names. XHTML was introduced to promote consistency, interoperability, and compatibility with XML-based technologies.

Basic Structure of an HTML Page:An HTML document consists of several essential components:- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.- `<html>`: The root element that contains all other elements.- `<head>`: Contains metadata and links to external resources.- `<meta>`: Provides metadata such as character encoding and viewport settings.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the document, displayed in the browser's title bar.- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the document.

Basic Tags in html:
HTML tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) that define the structure and content of a web page. Some common basic tags include:
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Defines headings of different levels.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
- `<a>`: Creates hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: Embeds images.
- `<ul>`: Defines an unordered list.
- `<ol>`: Defines an ordered list.
- `<li>`: Defines a list item.
- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Defines a table row.
- `<td>`: Defines a table cell.
- `<form>`: Defines an HTML form for user input.
- `<input>`: Defines an input control within a form.

Types of Tags: 
HTML tags can be categorized into different types based on their functionality:
- Structural Tags: Define the structure of the document, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Semantic Tags: Provide meaning to the content, like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`.
- Text Formatting Tags: Modify the appearance of text, such as `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, and `<i>`.
- Link Tags: Create hyperlinks, such as `<a>`.
- Image Tags: Embed images, such as `<img>`.
- List Tags: Create lists, including `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`.
- Table Tags: Organize data into tables, such as `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc.

Lists in html:
HTML supports two main types of lists: ordered lists (`ol`) and unordered lists (`ul`). Ordered lists display items in a numbered sequence, while unordered lists display items with bullet points.

Tables in html:
HTML tables are used to display data in rows and columns. They consist of table rows (`<tr>`) containing table data (`<td>`) or table headers (`<th>`). Tables are commonly used to organize and present tabular data in a structured format.

Image tag in html:
The `<img>` tag is used to embed images in HTML documents. It requires a `src` attribute, which specifies the URL or path to the image file, and an `alt` attribute, which provides alternative text for the image. Images enhance the visual appeal of web pages and are often used to convey information or complement textual content.

Forms in html:
HTML forms (`<form>`) are used to collect user input. They consist of various input elements (`<input>`) such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons. Forms allow users to interact with web pages by entering data and submitting it to a server for processing. They are commonly used for tasks like user authentication, data submission, and online transactions.

Frames in html:
Frames were a feature in HTML used to divide a web page into multiple sections, each containing a separate HTML document. They allowed for the display of multiple web pages within a single browser window. However, frames are considered obsolete and are rarely used in modern web development due to their drawbacks, including accessibility issues, search engine optimization challenges, and usability concerns.

Types of Style Sheets:
1. Inline Style Sheets: Inline styles are CSS styles applied directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. They override any external or internal styles defined for the element. While convenient for quick styling, inline styles can lead to code repetition and decreased maintainability.
2. External Style Sheets: External style sheets are separate CSS files linked to HTML documents using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section. They allow for centralized styling, promoting consistency across multiple pages. Changes made to an external style sheet are automatically applied to all linked HTML documents.
Style Classes:Style classes are reusable sets of CSS rules that can be applied to multiple HTML elements. They allow for consistent styling across different parts of a website. Classes are defined using the `.class` selector in CSS and applied to HTML elements using the `class` attribute.

Properties of CSS:
1. Font: CSS properties related to typography, including `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-style`, `font-weight`, and `line-height`. These properties control the appearance of text on a web page.2. Background: CSS properties for setting the background of elements, including `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-repeat`, `background-position`, and `background-size`.3. Border: CSS properties for styling borders around elements, such as `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color`, `border-radius`, and `border-collapse`.4. Text: CSS properties for text formatting, such as `color`, `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `text-transform`, `letter-spacing`, and `word-spacing`.5. Margin: CSS properties for controlling the space outside an element's border, including `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left`.6. Padding: CSS properties for controlling the space between an element's content and its border, including `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left`.

Positioning in css:
Positioning in CSS refers to the placement of elements within the document flow. CSS provides several positioning properties, including `position`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`, which allow developers to precisely control the position of elements on a web page. Common positioning techniques include static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.

Line and marker properties:
In CSS are used to control the appearance of list items (`<li>`) and their associated markers (bullets or numbers) in ordered and unordered lists. CSS properties such as `list-style-type`, `list-style-image`, and `list-style-position` allow developers to customize the appearance and placement of list markers.

Outlines:
CSS outlines are similar to borders but are drawn outside the element's border box, without affecting the element's layout. The `outline` property is used to specify the style, color, and width of an outline. Outlines are commonly used to highlight elements, such as form fields, when they receive focus or validation errors.

Introduction to JavaScript:
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It enables dynamic, interactive behavior on web pages by allowing manipulation of HTML and CSS, as well as interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM). JavaScript can also be used on the server-side (e.g., with Node.js) for building scalable web applications.

Variables in javascript:
Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. They are declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. Variables can hold various types of data, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and functions.
Operations:
JavaScript supports various types of operations, including arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`), and more.
Control Structures:
Control structures in JavaScript allow for conditional execution and looping. Common control structures include `if` statements, `else` statements, `else if` statements, `switch` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do-while` loops.
Keywords:
JavaScript has a set of reserved keywords that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names or function names). Some common keywords include `var`, `let`, `const`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `return`, `break`, `continue`, `switch`, and `case`.

Arrays in javascript:
Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can hold elements of any data type and have dynamic sizes. Arrays are declared using square brackets (`[]`) and can be accessed using zero-based indexing.

Functions in javascript:
Functions in JavaScript are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. They are declared using the `function` keyword, followed by a name and a set of parentheses containing optional parameters. Functions can optionally return a value using the `return` statement.

Mathematical Functions & String Functions:
JavaScript provides built-in mathematical functions for performing common mathematical operations, such as `Math.abs()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.floor()`, `Math.round()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.min()`, and `Math.random()`. String functions allow for manipulation and formatting of strings, such as `charAt()`, `concat()`, `indexOf()`, `substring()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `trim()`.

Objects in javascript:
Objects in JavaScript are complex data types that can hold key-value pairs of properties and methods. They are declared using curly braces (`{}`) and can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

Expressions in javascript:
Expressions in JavaScript are combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluate to a single value. They can be simple or complex and can include arithmetic expressions, logical expressions, string expressions, and more.

Pattern Matching in javascript:
Pattern matching, also known as regular expressions, allows for matching patterns within strings. JavaScript provides the `RegExp` object and built-in methods such as `test()`, `exec()`, and `match()` for working with regular expressions.

Exception Handling:
Exception handling in JavaScript allows for graceful error handling and recovery from unexpected errors. It is achieved using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions and execute cleanup code.

Built in Objects:
JavaScript provides several built-in objects that serve various purposes, including `Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Math`, `Date`, `RegExp`, `Error`, and more. These objects provide methods and properties for performing common tasks and operations.

Events and Event Handling:
Events in JavaScript are actions that occur in the browser, such as mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or page loading. Event handling involves attaching event listeners to HTML elements and executing code in response to specific events.

Form Validation:
Form validation in JavaScript ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submitting the form. It involves checking input fields for required values, valid formats, and constraints using conditional statements and regular expressions.
Mouse Events - Cursor, Clicks:
Mouse events in JavaScript allow for interaction with web pages using the mouse. Common mouse events include `mousemove`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`, `dblclick`, and `contextmenu`. These events can be used to track mouse movement, detect clicks, and trigger actions.

Introduction to XML (Extensible Markup Language):
XML, which stands for Extensible Markup Language, is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It was designed to store and transport data, with a focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across different systems and platforms.
Syntax:XML documents consist of text data marked up with tags, similar to HTML. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`
<>`) and come in pairs: start tags and end tags. Start tags begin with `<` and end with `>`, while end tags begin with `</` and end with `>`. Tags can contain attributes, which provide additional information about the element.

Document Structure:
XML documents are hierarchical in nature and have a tree-like structure. They consist of a single root element, which contains all other elements. Elements can have child elements, which in turn can have their own child elements, forming a nested structure.
Document Type Definitions (DTD):
Document Type Definitions, or DTDs, are used to define the structure and rules of an XML document. They specify which elements and attributes are allowed, as well as their relationships and content models. DTDs can be declared within the XML document using the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration or in a separate external file.

Namespaces in xhtml:
Namespaces in XML allow for the creation of uniquely named elements and attributes to avoid naming conflicts. They are declared using the `xmlns` attribute, which assigns a unique identifier to a namespace URI. Namespaces are commonly used in XML documents to integrate elements and attributes from multiple vocabularies or schemas.

XML Schemas:
XML Schemas, also known as XSD (XML Schema Definition), provide a more powerful and flexible way to define the structure and constraints of XML documents compared to DTDs. They use XML syntax to specify data types, element structures, and validation rules. XML Schemas are commonly used for data interchange and validation in XML-based applications.
Displaying Raw XML Documents:Raw XML documents can be displayed in web browsers or text editors, where they are rendered as plain text with tags visible. Browsers may also provide syntax highlighting and folding features to improve readability and navigation of XML documents.
Displaying XML Documents with CSS:XML documents can be styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control their presentation and layout. CSS allows developers to define styles for XML elements, such as fonts, colors, margins, and borders. This enables customization of the visual appearance of XML content when displayed in web browsers or other rendering engines.
XML Processors:XML processors are software components responsible for parsing and interpreting XML documents. They read XML data, validate its structure and content against defined rules (e.g., DTDs or XML Schemas), and provide access to the parsed data for further processing or manipulation. XML processors may also support transformation (e.g., XSLT), querying (e.g., XPath), and serialization of XML data.
